# Level 4 - Finishing touches

There are some finishing touches to make before we can call our Minesweeper game complete.

1. Generating random boards
   - Remember the hint about using [Random.List.shuffle](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-community/random-extra/latest/Random-List#shuffle)?
1. Starting a new game without having to refresh the page
   - Hint: use the smiley face in the top center of the game
1. Showing the remaining number of mines in the top left corner
   - This should be the total number of mines on the board minus the count of flagged cells
1. Showing the elapsed time (in seconds) in the top right corner
   - Hint: [`Time.every`](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm/time/latest/Time#every)
